alt: Magnetic modelling of inductively coupled coils for wireless power
description: <center><strong>Motivation</strong></center>  

    To facilitate design of implantable sensors for [electromyography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromyography "electromyography") (EMG).
    Targeted sensors could provide better inputs for [prosthetic device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis#Myoelectric "prosthetic device") control.  

    <center><strong>Research</strong></center>  

    Modelling magnetic properties of solenoid coils to quickly determine lumped circuit equivalents for use in wireless inductive power design.  
    
    <center><strong>Novelty</strong></center>  

    Use of finite element software to obtain rapid results for combinations of many variables including relative coil orientations and presence of [magnetic core](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_core) materials.
